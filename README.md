# Superlatives-Game

A repository for a full stack superlatives game to play between 7 of my friends. This project utilizes Flask, HTML, CSS, and JS in order to provide real time responses to interactions made between different pages within the webapp so the host of the game can see and monitor player responses in real time. This app primarily works off of flask socketio communication to handle this. The final product is currently deployed on render at https://superlatives-game.onrender.com/ and https://superlatives-game.onrender.com/host for the player and host respectively.
